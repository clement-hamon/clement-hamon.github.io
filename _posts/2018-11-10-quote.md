**"If I'm baking a cake and it fails, it becomes a pudding."** ï»¿Cliff Crozier

This quote is extracted from a video [Life Lessons From 100-Year-Olds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AThycGCakk).
I like it because it's a funny analogy for looking at things on the bright side and turn any situation into an opportunity.
