Finally, the most important step about blogging, but also the easiest one, is done. I always wanted to have a space where I can write down my thoughts and
experiments, not only for myself, but also for others to read, comment and criticise.
I took sooooo much from the internet community that I feel now the need to give something back.

But now comes the hardest part, I have to commit to deliver content on a regular basis.
I've always been impressed when I find blogs where people write articles every week for more than 10 years.

I am a kind of perfectionist, I know I can write tones of articles and never publish them thinking they are not worth it.
I will try fight against my own personality in order to deliver something knowing it could be improved.
So if you think I wrote things that are not correct or just because you think differently please please please write a comment, and I will be more than happy to take them into consideration.

As I can see, there are 14 "I"s in this article, I promise that it will be the first and last time. From now on, I will focus on delivering interesting (or not ^^) stuff that can benefits others.

PS: As you probably already spotted, English is not my mother tongue, so if you see any typo feel free to let me know.
